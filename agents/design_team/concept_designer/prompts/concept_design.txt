{{ user_request }}

TARGET AUDIENCE: {{ target_audience }}
PLATFORM: {{ platform }}

DESIGN A COMPELLING GAME CONCEPT:

1. CORE GAMEPLAY LOOP (3-5 steps)
   - Define the repeating cycle of actions
   - Must be engaging and clear
   - Examples: "Explore → Fight → Collect → Upgrade → Repeat"

2. PLAYER ABILITIES
   - Start with 2-3 basic abilities
   - Plan 2-4 unlockable abilities
   - Each ability should feel impactful
   - Ensure abilities combine well (synergy)

3. UNIQUE MECHANICS (What makes this game special?)
   - 1-3 innovative mechanics not commonly seen
   - Must enhance core loop
   - Should be easy to learn, hard to master

4. DIFFICULTY CURVE
   - How does challenge progress?
   - When are new mechanics introduced?
   - Checkpoint/save system

5. WIN/LOSE CONDITIONS
   - Clear, measurable goals
   - Fair and achievable

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must be implementable in 2-4 weeks with AI agents
- Suitable for {{ platform }}
- Budget-conscious (prefer reusable mechanics)
- Focus on fun and polish over content quantity

IMPORTANT:
- Output ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no explanations outside JSON)
- Be creative but practical
- Consider mobile/touch controls if platform is "web"
- Reference successful games for inspiration but add unique twists

EXAMPLES OF GREAT DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Celeste: Tight controls + gradual difficulty + forgiving checkpoints
- Hollow Knight: Exploration + skill progression + optional challenges
- Baba Is You: Unique mechanic (rule manipulation) defines entire game
